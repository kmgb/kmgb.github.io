        <h1>Web Browser Extensions</h1>
        <p>I have developed the following browser extensions for chromium-based browsers. They are not available on the Chrome Web Store, but you can still install them by loading them as unpacked extensions.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/kmgb/new-tab-html">New Tab HTML (GitHub)</a></h2>
        <p>Allows for your own custom HTML to be used as your browser's new tab page, overriding it. Example code is provided for website links, but any valid HTML is possible.</p>
        <p>I was inspired to develop this because of Microsoft Edge (Chromium)'s horrible new tab page performance on startup, as well as Brave's inflexible and ugly new tab page (imho).</p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/kmgb/skiprope">Skiprope (GitHub)</a></h2>
        <p>Register address bar keywords to use as webpage shortcuts. Useful for accessing complicated URLs with an easy-to-remember name, and without having to find it in your bookmarks. For example, standup zoom links: searching <code>'! standup'</code> can send you to https://zoom.us/j/XYZABC.</p>
        <p>Developed as a response to an <abbr title="Jumprope">extension of similar name</abbr> that forwards all search queries to its own server to perform a similar function, but is likely selling its users' search history.</p>
